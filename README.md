PlatePal is a web application that allows users to create and share cooking recipes. The recipe creation includes the use of AI to take an image a user has provided and fill out the recipe fields for them. 
Recipes can be made public or private by the user depending on their preference. Public recipes posted by other users can be copied and saved to your own library. The recipes within a user’s library can be used to create a smart list. 
The user simply needs to choose the meals they wish to buy, and a personalised shopping list will be created. After the shopping list has been created it can be used to tick off items while they are shopping. 
As the application is web based this allows the user to access their shopping list anywhere whether they are on their personal computer or mobile device. Calorie management is also made possible through selecting recipes from the user’s recipe library. 
Recipes can be added or removed to track the calories of breakfast, lunch dinner and snacks. This assists the user in dieting habits as they can clearly see items that can modified to reach calorie goals.
